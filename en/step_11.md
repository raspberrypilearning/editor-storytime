<h2 class="c-project-heading--task">Challenge: add more details</h2>

--- task ---

Make your story even more interesting by adding some more lists with items that your program can pick from.

--- /task ---

For example, you could create a list of `enemies` or `heroes`. Or give the dragon more detail: you could create a list called `colours` that decides what colour skin the dragon's scales are, or a list called `breath` that determines whether the dragon breathes fire, steam, or frost.

Your story can be as long as you like, and the only limit is your imagination!
